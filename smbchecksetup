Setup of the samba mount checker cgi script.

First, setup an apache directory for cgi-bin. This should already be in the httpd.conf file.
The path should be something like /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/cgi-bin, however the directory does 
not exist. Therefore you will need to create it with sudo mkdir /opt/IBM/HTTPServer/cgi-bin.

Next, copy the script into that folder and double-check that it has execute permissions.

Finally, edit the httpd.conf file:

Change this section from:

<Directory "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
</Directory>

to:

<Directory "/opt/IBM/HTTPServer/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from 192.168.0.0/24
</Directory>

Save the file

run
sudo ./apachectl configtest
sudo ./apachectl graceful
